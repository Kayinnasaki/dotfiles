## My dotfiles are bad do not use them I just don't wanna worry about signing into a private repo

**overstow** is for killing whatever original dotfiles are there. Works like **stow** but uses *--adopt* and then a git restore to transform the orignal file into a symlink. It is a stupid way to do this.
